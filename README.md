# Voice Calculator

## Overview

The Voice Calculator is a web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to perform calculations using their voice. This application utilizes both speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities, making it a convenient and user-friendly tool for performing mathematical operations.

## Features

* __Voice Input :__ Users can input mathematical expressions by speaking into their microphone. The application will convert their speech into text and use it for calculations.

* __Text-to-Speech Output :__ The results of the calculations are presented to the user through text-to-speech synthesis, making it accessible to users with visual impairments or those who prefer auditory feedback.

* __Basic Operations :__ The Voice Calculator supports basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* __Clear Function :__ Users can clear the input field to start a new calculation.

## Technologies Used

* __HTML :__ The structure of the web page is defined using HTML, including input fields and buttons.

* __CSS :__ CSS is used for styling the user interface, making the application visually appealing and responsive.

* __JavaScript :__ JavaScript is the core programming language used to implement the calculator logic, speech recognition, and text-to-speech functionality.

* __Web Speech API :__ This API is used to capture voice input and provide text-to-speech output. It includes SpeechRecognition for speech input and SpeechSynthesis for text-to-speech.

## Getting Started

To use the Voice Calculator, follow these steps:

* Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.

* Open the __index.html__ file in your web browser.

* Allow the browser to access your microphone when prompted for speech recognition.

* Start speaking a mathematical expression, e.g., "2 plus 3"

* The application will convert your speech to text and display the result using text-to-speech synthesis.

* You can click the "Clear" button to reset the input field for a new calculation.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Voice Calculator:

* Say, "2 plus 3"

* The application will display "2 + 3" in the input field.

* After a brief moment, the application will respond with "The result is five."
